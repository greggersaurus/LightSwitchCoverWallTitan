## Light Switch Cover Wall Titan Model
The idea for this project was to create a light switch cover that creates the
 illusion that there is a monster living in the walls.

### Design
This was my second attempt at using Blender for 3D modeling, and I wanted to
 experiment with the sculpting tools. The approach was to just keep 
 experimenting and using the different brushes until I was happy with the 
 resulting face. Once this was complete I imported the Rounded Lightswitch
 cover design and cut away a portion to expose the sculpted face. Steps were
 then taken to reduce the complexity of the face (specificaly for portions
 not visible after printing) and to make sure there was room for the light
 switch to still work. 

A good learning experience, and I'm happy with the final product, but the 
 design approach could have been better. If I were to redesign I would make
 more manual coarse adjustments to get the general shape of the face before
 using the sculpting tool. 

### Influence 
This is based on a scene from the Attack on Titan manga (see 
 reference_images/wall_titan_manga.png)

### Sources
The original light switch cover model was pulled from 
 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53554 (Rounded Lightswitch Cover by zthralls)

The reference image from from a Google image search for "wall titan" or 
 something similar. I cannot find the exact source where this image came from
 but my guess is http://attackontitan.wikia.com/ or something similar. The 
 scene is from Chapter 33 Wall I believe.

### WallTitanSculpt.blend
Reference image was added so that it was visible when front view was selected.
 Added rounded lightswitch cover and cut hole for titan face to show through.
 Titan face was created by using scuplting tool with dynamic face division
 to ideally add detail where needed. Not extremely pleased with this option
 as it created a lot of (probably) unnecessary vertices. 

### WallTitanPrintReady.blend
WallTitanSculpt.blend was modified to be 3D printer ready. This consisted of
 closing up titan face and reduce as many non-visible faces to make printing
 move quicker. This was done in an extremely manual process, hence why this
 was moved to a different file. Again, probably could have done better here
 to not using scupling tool with dynamic face division so much...

### Software Requirements
This was modeled in Blender 2.75a.

### 3D Printing
A MakerBot Replicator 2 was used to produce physical light switch cover. Settings
 were for highest quality and smallest possible layer height. Do not remember
 other details, other than print time took roughly 8 hours.
